# DanBot
Just some dumb discord bot. You can use my code to build your own bot too.

### Requirements
nodejs installed

### To run
1. Make sure you are in the project directory
2. Enter "node ." into terminal/console

### The bot won't run?
If you want to run or test locally, you will need your own Discord client token and change the value of "const CLIENT_TOKEN" from "CONFIG.client_token" to "whateveryourtokenis" in index.js. Keep in mind it needs to be in a string format, so if you're just copying and pasting your token in, you will need to put double quotes around it.

### Ibsearch isn't working?
This is the API key isn't provided. You can get your own API key for free from Ibsearch.
